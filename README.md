> # My dotfiles

---

These are my dotfiles
They're what I use on my main daily driving system

A bunch of the stuff is stolen from other places

I mainly use helix nowadays but I also often use neovim
And my neovim config is [this](https://github.com/fruity-fkf/nvim "this")
there's nothing more to say TBH

I'm using both kitty and wezterm(depends on my mood)

for a file browser I am using yazi which is AMAZING

I'm a guy who steals from other peoples configs deal with it

The bar is [Hyprpanel](https://hyprpanel.com/configuration/themes.html) or waybar depending on my mood

My colorscheme is either catppuccin or Gruvbox material
